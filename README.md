[Disarray](http://www.disarray-chat.herokuapp.com) is a clone of the popular chat app [Discord](http://www.discord.com). It allows users to create or join chat servers that can each contain multiple chat channels. Users can send instant messages on these channels and those messages will be broadcast to all members of that server, or they can choose to privately direct message other users.

## Technologies Used

Disarray was created with a Rails backend and a React frontend, with Redux for state management. Rails' Action Cable was used to integrate WebSockets into the backend and facilitate live chat.
